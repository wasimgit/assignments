/**
*********************
* Example page theme style.
* This is an example to demonstrate custom styling for a page or a page type.
* Most of the component styling should be loaded as per required. However, if
* any page requires some special style, those should be added to the
* page-specific SCSS files and the libraries should be loaded separately. The
* added libraries can either be added using preprocess methods or attaching the
* library in Twig file using {{ attach_library('theme/library') }} .
